## Installation üíª

**‚ùó In order to start using Unping Ui you must have the [Flutter SDK][flutter_install_link] installed on your machine.**

### Prerequisites

Before you can use Unping UI components in your project, you need to install and set up [fpx][fpx_link] (Flutter Paste X):

1. **Install fpx globally:**
   ```sh
   dart pub global activate fpx
   ```

2. **Add the unping-ui repository to fpx:**
   ```sh
   fpx repository add https://github.com/unping/unping-ui
   ```

3. **Use fpx to paste components from unping-ui into your project:**
   ```sh
   fpx add <component_name>
   ```

That's it! You're now ready to use Unping UI components in your Flutter project. üéâ

## Usage üöÄ

Once installed, you can browse and add any component from the unping-ui library:

```sh
# List all available components
fpx list

# Add a specific component to your project
fpx add button
fpx add card
fpx add input_field
```

## Develop new widgets

For adding new widgets, place them in lib/ folder. And don't forget to add them to th widgetbook app. Add a wrapper in widgetbook/lib for your new widget.
After adding a widget, don't forget to trigger the code generation for widgetbook:
```
cd widgetbook && dart run build_runner build -d
```

To see Widgetbook in action:
```
cd widgetbook && flutter run
```

The components will be copied directly into your project, ready to use and customize!
