Create a new widget in the `lib/unping_ui.dart` file and export it. The widget should be a simple button with the text "Coolest test button in the world". Keep the implementation minimal, focusing on the button's appearance and basic functionality. The button should be styled to fit within the existing design of the Unping UI library.
